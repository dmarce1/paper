abstract = "We present the piecewise parabolic method, a higher-order extension of Godunov's method. There are several new features of this method which distinguish it from other higher-order Godunov-type methods. We use a higher-order spatial interpolation than previously used, which allows for a steeper representation of discontinuities, particularly contact discontinuities. We introduce a simpler and more robust algorithm for calculating the nonlinear wave interactions used to compute fluxes. Finally, we recognize the need for additional dissipation in any higher-order Godunov method of this type, and introduce it in such a way so as not to degrade the quality of the results."

abstract = "We describe a hybrid scheme for cosmological simulations that incorporates a Lagrangean particle-mesh (PM) algorithm to follow the collisionless matter with the higher order accurate piecewise parabolic method (PPM) to solve the equations of gas dynamics. Both components interact through the gravitational potential, which requires the solution of Poisson's equation, here done by Fourier transforms. Due to the vast range of conditions that occur in cosmological flows (pressure differences of up to fourteen orders of magnitude), a number of additions and modifications to PPM were required to produce accurate results. These are described, as are a suite of cosmological tests."
