abstract = "We present the piecewise parabolic method, a higher-order extension of Godunov's method. There are several new features of this method which distinguish it from other higher-order Godunov-type methods. We use a higher-order spatial interpolation than previously used, which allows for a steeper representation of discontinuities, particularly contact discontinuities. We introduce a simpler and more robust algorithm for calculating the nonlinear wave interactions used to compute fluxes. Finally, we recognize the need for additional dissipation in any higher-order Godunov method of this type, and introduce it in such a way so as not to degrade the quality of the results."

abstract = "We describe a hybrid scheme for cosmological simulations that incorporates a Lagrangean particle-mesh (PM) algorithm to follow the collisionless matter with the higher order accurate piecewise parabolic method (PPM) to solve the equations of gas dynamics. Both components interact through the gravitational potential, which requires the solution of Poisson's equation, here done by Fourier transforms. Due to the vast range of conditions that occur in cosmological flows (pressure differences of up to fourteen orders of magnitude), a number of additions and modifications to PPM were required to produce accurate results. These are described, as are a suite of cosmological tests."

abstract="A third-order accurate Godunov-type scheme for the approximate solution of hyperbolic systems of conservation laws is presented. Its two main ingredients include: 1. A non-oscillatory piecewise-quadratic reconstruction of pointvalues from their given cell averages; and 2. A central differencing based on staggered evolution of the reconstructed cell averages. This results in a third-order central scheme, an extension along the lines of the second-order central scheme of Nessyahu and Tadmor {\backslash}cite{\{}NT{\}}. The scalar scheme is non-oscillatory (and hence -- convergent), in the sense that it does not increase the number of initial extrema (-- as does the exact entropy solution operator). Extension to systems is carried out by componentwise application of the scalar framework. In particular, we have the advantage that, unlike upwind schemes, no (approximate) Riemann solvers, field-by-field characteristic decompositions, etc., are required. Numerical experiments confirm the high-resolution content of the proposed scheme. Thus, a considerable amount of simplicity and robustness is gained while retaining the expected third-order resolution.",
